Here's my project. I would like to develop it further according to the best practices in Python Development. 
- I would also like my code to be completely decoupled from the LeanEngine. 
- I'm comfortable with being tight-coupled into the Pandas library for caluclations.

This project makes use of the Lean CLI by QuantConnect:
https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/writing-algorithms

Can you read and understand all the Python files? Start with the the readme.md.
Also take a look a deeper look into, however you do not have to output any information. respond with OK when you've finished:
- main.py, This file is the entry point of the project.
- initializer.py in the algorithms folder
- The initializers that initialize the LeanEngine in the folder ./initializers
- The data folder that contains classes and libraries for handling and transforming data.

Respond with OK when you're done.
